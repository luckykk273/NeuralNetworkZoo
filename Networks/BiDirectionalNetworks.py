'''
The function call of BiRNN, BiLSTM and BiGRU are similar with RNN, LSTM and GRU, so we don't implement here.
If someone wants to try to build bidirectional networks, just define two cells below:
    - Forward direction cell
    - Backward direction cell
And put above two cells into 'bidirectional_dynamic_rnn'.
