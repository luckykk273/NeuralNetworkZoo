All Neural Networks can be called to demo.
Note that RNN, LSTM, GRU has initial state problem!
If set initial state to None, there is no problem;
Else there is error as below:
'tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: ConcatOp : Dimensions of inputs should match'

Answer:
When our data is not divisible by batch size, the last batch size will not fit the initial state shape!
ex:
    data size = 100
    batch size = initial state = 16
    100/16 = 6...4
    (last batch size = 4) != (initial state = 16)

So if someone wants to use RNN, LSTM, GRU with initial state:
    - Don't use the last batch which is not divisible by batch size.
      (Just throw the last batch away.)
    - Make data size can be divisible by batch size.
      (Change data size from 100 to 96.)
